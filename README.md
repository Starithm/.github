## 🚀 Our Mission

To develop open tools and research at the cutting edge of:
- NLP for space alerts (GCNs, ATels, etc.) - In progress (NovaTrace)
- Space situational awareness (SSA)
- Satellite telemetry and event analytics


Our long-term vision includes scaling toward **real-time intelligent systems** for satellite safety, astronomical insights, and space traffic management.
